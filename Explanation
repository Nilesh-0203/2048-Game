Line-by-line explanation of the Dockerfile :

FROM ubuntu:22.04
This line specifies the base image that your image will be built on. In this case, you are using the official Ubuntu 22.04 image.

RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y nginx zip curl
These lines update the package list and install the Nginx web server, Zip archiver, and Curl command-line tool.

RUN echo "daemon off;" >>/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
This line adds a line to the Nginx configuration file to disable the daemon mode. This will prevent Nginx from starting automatically when the container is started.

RUN curl -o /var/www/html/master.zip -L https://codeload.github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048/zip/master
RUN cd /var/www/html/ && unzip master.zip && mv 2048-master/* . && rm -rf 2048-master master.zip
These lines download the 2048 game from GitHub, unzip it, and move the game files to the root of the web server's document root directory.

EXPOSE 80
This line exposes port 80 from the container. This means that when a container is created from this image, it will be able to receive traffic on port 80.

CMD ["/usr/sbin/nginx", "-c" , "/etc/nginx/nginx.conf"]
This line specifies the command that will be run when the container is started. In this case, it will start the Nginx web server.
